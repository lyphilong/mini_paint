* Create 2 layers: one to draw, one to control
	1: Draw panel 
		To handle the the shape and draw 
			resize the shape 
			change color, position of shape
	2: ControlPanel
		



Panel is just a container to contain object and act to be child of a frame



* Create a texbox when right click.
---->The null layout will cause some problem that I couldnt understand so try manager layout as much as possible.
